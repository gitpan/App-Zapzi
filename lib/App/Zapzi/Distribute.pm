Distributer roles.

=head2 destination

Where to send the file to. The distribution role will validate this.

=head2 completion_message

Message from the distributer after completion - should be set in both
error and success cases, but blank if no distributer has been invoked.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 distribute

Distributes the file according to the method set on the class or the
default configured distribution. Returns 1 if OK (including no
distributor defined), undef on failure.
