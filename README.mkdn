# DESCRIPTION

Zapzi is a command line tool to take articles - from files or from the
web - and create eBooks for reading later.

## FEATURES

- Can read articles from local files or via HTTP.
- Understands plain text, HTML and Markdown format articles.
- HTML is converted to a more readable form (eg no menus or
footers) to make the article easier to view on an eReader.
- Articles can be stored in different folders to organise your reading.
- eBooks are created in MOBI format (other formats should be added later).
- Once you publish a folder of articles to an eBook file, the
articles are archived so you can retrieve them later if needed.

## CONFIGURATION

Zapzi needs very little configuration to get running - just type 

    $ zapzi init

and it will create a directory (by default ~/.zapzi) to store its
database and files. You can override this directory by setting the
environment variable `ZAPZI_DIR`.

## ADDING ARTICLES

To add an article, use `zapzi add` with a filename on your computer
or an HTTP URL. Remember to quote URLs if they include space or shell
special characters, eg

    $ zapzi add 'http://example.com/article?id=4'

Zapzi will download a copy and store it in its database. Note that if
you need to log into a site this will not work - save a copy of the
page locally using your browser and then point Zapzi at the file.

Zapzi will detect the file type and if it is HTML it will use
[HTML::ExtractMain](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?HTML::ExtractMain) to strip out non-essential parts of the page such
as menus. Other formats are treated as plain text with Markdown.

## FOLDERS

By default, Zapzi will store articles in the 'Inbox' folder. This can
be changed by using the `-f` option, eg

    $ zapzi add -f Foo project.txt

In order to use other folders you will need to create them first using
the `make-folder` or `mkf` command, eg

    $ zapzi make-folder Foo

Folders can be deleted with the `delete-folder` or `rd` command.
Note that this will also delete all articles in the folder.

To see a summary of your folders and how many articles are in them use
the `list-folders` or `lsf` command.

    $ zapzi lsf

    Inbox        2
    Archive      4
    Foo          1

To see a summary of a particular folder, use `list` or `ls`:

    $ zapzi ls -f Foo
    Foo      1 05-Jul-2013 Project readme

## PUBLISHING

To create an eBook, run `zapzi publish` or `zapzi pub`. By default
this will publish articles from the Inbox folder; use the `-f` option
to select another folder.

If everything worked OK, Zapzi will create a new eBook in the ebooks
sub-directory of your Zapzi directory, eg `~/.zapzi/ebooks`.

When you publish a folder, the articles are moved to the Archive folder.

Instead of publishing, if you want to see a copy of an article use
`zapzi show`. This will send a copy to the standard output. It will
not archive the article.

# FUTURE PLANS

This is an early version of Zapzi and although the basic functionality
is there I plan to improve it further. If you have any suggestions
please add them to the issue tracker at Github.

- Support other ways to fetch articles, eg FTP or IMAP for email.
- Support other article formats, eg mbox/maildir.
- Add the ability to read sources with state, eg RSS feeds.
- Improve text extraction and formatting.
- Publish to other eBook formats such as EPUB or PDF.
- Add options to distribute published eBooks, eg by email or
copy to an eReader.
